# AI Report: Phase 1 Development

## Overview

This document summarizes the AI-assisted development workflow used during Phase 1 of the MIT Quackhacks LABS challenge.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Quantum Circuit Implementation
- AI generated CUDA-Q kernels for 2-body (RZZ) and 4-body (RZZZZ) operations
- Human verification ensured gate sequences matched paper equations (Trotterized counteradiabatic evolution)
- Result: Efficient circuit with 236K entangling gates (vs. 1.4M for QAOA)

### 2. Test Suite Development
- AI created 8 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Energy function correctness (non-negative integer, symmetries)
  - Interaction structure validation (bounds, counts, uniqueness)
  - Ground truth validation (brute-force comparison for N ≤ 6)
- Human review ensured test logic matched LABS problem requirements
- All tests passing; 100% code coverage for core components

### 3. Classical Baseline (MTS)
- AI implemented Memetic Tabu Search with:
  - Tournament selection for parent selection
  - Tabu list-based neighborhood restriction
  - Multi-generation evolution
- Human verification: MTS outperforms random search for small N

### 4. Documentation
- AI auto-generated docstrings, API docs, README sections
- Human validation: Technical accuracy, completeness, clarity

## Verification Strategy Applied

- ✓ Energy symmetries: `E(s) = E(-s) = E(reverse(s))`
- ✓ Brute-force ground truth: Exhaustive search for N ≤ 6
- ✓ Format invariants: Bitstrings maintain ±1 values throughout
- ✓ Reproducibility: All experiments run with fixed random seeds

## AI Hallucination Prevention

1. **Test-first approach:** AI wrote tests before implementation
2. **Cross-validation:** Results compared to brute-force solver
3. **Physical constraints:** Energy bounds, array shapes, index bounds verified
4. **Human code review:** Every AI-generated function audited before integration
